        <b>ðŸ’¡ Meet Saad:</b> A 13-Year-Old on a Mission<br />
        While most teens are still exploring what they like, Saad is already
        building his future. He began working at 12, diving into social media
        strategy and helping small brands grow online.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started as content experiments turned into real marketing work. Now
        a skilled Social Media Specialist, Saad understands branding, audience
        engagement, and digital storytellingâ€”all self-taught.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, heâ€™s stepped into Web3, learning blockchain and exploring new
        ways technology is reshaping business. With a passion for
        entrepreneurship, Saad doesnâ€™t wait for opportunitiesâ€”he creates them.
      </p>
      <p>This is just the beginning of his journey.</p>
